Welcome to Miraa, an AI-powered marketing generator developed by our team during the <a href="https://lablab.ai/event/openai-hackathon">Global OpenAI Stack Hackathon</a>.

With Miraa, unleash the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize your advertising strategies and reach new heights in marketing effectiveness.

Our app provides a fully digitalized package for our clients. We offer a range of services, including the creation of a logo, ads that can be used on social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, a website, and marketing videos. In order to enhance the quality of our videos, we use a technology called DeepFake. This technology generates faces which are then placed onto the video to create a more engaging advertisement. To create the ads, we use two different technologies called dalle and gpt3. Dalle is used to generate images, while gpt3 is used for text. The logo is also created using dalle for the image and gpt3 for the text under the image. For the website, we will use dalle for images and gpt3 to code the website itself. Additionally, we will be adding automation to our app to streamline the entire process. 

Our app offers a comprehensive range of services that can potentially have a significant impact on the market. The fields in which our app can be used includes branding, digital marketing, web development, and video production.One potential way to use client data and requests of images for further work is to analyze the data to identify trends and patterns in the type of images that clients are requesting. This can help us to tailor our services to meet the specific needs and preferences of your clients. For example, if we notice that clients are frequently requesting certain types of images or logos, we could focus on developing more options in that style., our app has the potential to make a significant impact on the market and attract a wide range of clients.

This is a repository that houses the frontend design for our exciting AI-Generator project. 
Our project is aimed at using cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technologies to generate unique and creative pieces of art.

This repository is part of a larger project that consists of three separate GitHub repositories. 

The frontend design repository (AI-Generator-frontend) communicates with two separate backend repositories, each of which is built with a different technology stack.

The first backend repository is a NodeJS backend hosted on GitHub at:
- https://github.com/labonzique/deepdream_backend_webserver
This backend provides a powerful and flexible platform for generating unique and exciting art using deep learning technologies.

The second backend repository is a Flask backend hosted on GitHub at:
- https://github.com/alfaromeo13/AI-Generator-backend.
This backend is built with the Flask framework and provides a user-friendly and intuitive API for generating art.

Together, these three repositories provide a complete end-to-end solution for generating art using Artificial Intelligence technologies. Our frontend design repository (AI-Generator-frontend) is the central point of interaction for users, and provides a seamless and intuitive interface for generating art.

We are constantly working to improve our AI-Generator project, and we welcome feedback and contributions from the community. Thank you for your interest in our project, and we hope you enjoy using our AI-Generator frontend design.
