AI-Generator-frontend

Welcome to AI-Generator-frontend, a repository that houses the frontend design for our exciting AI-Generator project. Our project is aimed at using cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technologies to generate unique and creative pieces of art.

This repository is part of a larger project that consists of three separate GitHub repositories. The frontend design repository (AI-Generator-frontend) communicates with two separate backend repositories, each of which is built with a different technology stack.

The first backend repository is a NodeJS backend hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/labonzique/deepdream_backend_webserver. This backend provides a powerful and flexible platform for generating unique and exciting art using deep learning technologies.

The second backend repository is a Flask backend hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/alfaromeo13/AI-Generator-backend. This backend is built with the Flask framework and provides a user-friendly and intuitive API for generating art.

Together, these three repositories provide a complete end-to-end solution for generating art using Artificial Intelligence technologies. Our frontend design repository (AI-Generator-frontend) is the central point of interaction for users, and provides a seamless and intuitive interface for generating art.

We are constantly working to improve our AI-Generator project, and we welcome feedback and contributions from the community. Thank you for your interest in our project, and we hope you enjoy using our AI-Generator frontend design.
